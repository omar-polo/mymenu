.Sh RESOURCES

The appearance of the menu is defined through the \fBX Resource
Database\fR.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It MyMenu.font
The font name to use. By default is set to "fixed" if compiled without
Xft(3) support, "monospace" otherwise. Without Xft(3) only bitmap font
are supported.
.It MyMenu.layout
The layout of the menu. The possible values are "horizontal" and
"vertical", with the default being "horizontal". Every other value
than "horizontal" is treated like "vertical", but this is kinda an
implementation detail and not something to be relied on, since in the
future other layout could be added as well.
.It Mymenu.prompt
A string that is rendered before the user input. Default to "$ ".
.It MyMenu.width
The width of the menu. If a numeric value is given (e.g. 400) is
interpreted as pixel, if it ends with a percentage symbol `%'
(e.g. 40%) the relative percentage will be computed (relative to the
monitor width).
.It MyMenu.height
The height of the menu. Like MyMenu.width if a numeric value is given
is interpreted as pixel, if it ends with a percentage symbol `%' the
relative percentage will be computed (relative to the monitor height).
.It MyMenu.x
The X coordinate of the topmost left corner of the window. Much like
MyMenu.height and MyMenu.width both a pixel dimension and percentage
could be supplied. In addition to it, the special value "middle" could
be used: in that case the window will be centered on the x axes.
.It MyMenu.y
The Y coordinate of the topmost left corner of the window. Like the X
coordinate a pixel dimension, percentage dimension or the special
value "middle" could be supplied.
.It MyMenu.padding
Change the padding. In the horizontal layout the padding is the space
between the rectangle of the completion and the text as well as the
space between the prompt and the first completion. In the horizontal
layout the padding is the horizontal spacing between the window edge
and the text as well as the space up and down the text within the
completion. The default value is 10.
.It MyMenu.prompt.background
The background of the prompt.
.It MyMenu.prompt.foreground
The text color (foreground) of the prompt.
.It MyMenu.completion.background
The background of the completions.
.It MyMenu.completion.foreground
The text color of the completions.
.It MyMenu.completion_highlighted.background
The background of the selected completion.
.It MyMenu.completion_highlighted.foreground
The foreground of the selected completion.

.El

.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
If, instead of a numeric value, a not-valid number that terminates
with the % sign is supplied, then the default value for that field
will be treated as a percentage. Since this is a misuse of the
resources this behavior isn't strictly considered a bug.
.It
C-w (delete last word) does not work well with multi-byte string. The
whole UTF-8 support is still kinda na√Øve and should be improved.
.El

.Sh EXIT STATUS

0 when the user select an entry, 1 when the user press Esc, EX_USAGE
if used with wrong flags and EX_UNAVAILABLE if the connection to X
fails.
